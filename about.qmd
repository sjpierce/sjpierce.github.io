I am an applied statistician and researcher at 
[Michigan State University](https://msu.edu), working in the 
[Center for Statistical Training and Consulting (CSTAT)](https://cstat.msu.edu). 

Some of my current work focuses on:

* Quality improvement for children's mental health health services.
* A cost-benefit analysis of 
  [EFNEP](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/programs/capacity-grants/efnep/expanded-food-nutrition-education-program) 
  utilizing biomarkers of chronic disease risk.   
* Examining the effect of a cognitive-behavioral therapy on psychological, 
  functional, and disease-related outcomes in youth with childhood-onset lupus.
* Predicting the performance of medical students on a licensing examination.
