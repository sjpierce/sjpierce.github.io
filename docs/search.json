    "text": "Statisticians can demonstrate leadership in research projects by advocating for and engaging in reproducible research (Hochheimer et al., 2024). Reproducible research can be facilitated by using a set of software packages that combine into a powerful, integrated set of tools. The statistical software R, paired with RStudio Desktop (RStudio Team, 2025), is the foundation for a set of tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text along with R code that can be compiled to automatically produce a fully-formatted report, manuscript, website, or set of presentation slides complete with text, equations, figures, tables, and reference sections (Mair, 2016).\nWhile (Mair, 2016) introduces R Markdown as a tool for writing dynamic documents, Quarto (Allaire et al., 2025) is a next-generation tool that replaces R Markdown. Quarto will be a key part of the future of scientific publishing for those who want to do reproducible research. It can produce documents in many different formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and many more). Combining Quarto with TinyTeX enables production of very nice PDF files, which are great for distribution and archiving. Meanwhile, Git (Torvalds et al., 2025) and GitHub solve source code version control problems and facilitate collaboration on code (Bryan, 2018).\nMarwick, Boettiger, & Mullen (2018) discuss creating research compendiums that bundle collections of documents along with data files into custom R packages to make a research project more reproducible. These software packages become additional scholarly products that make manuscripts more reproducible."

The best way to do that is to use a script such as Reinstall_Packages.R under the older version to save a data file containing the names of installed packages, then remove the older version of R and replace it with the newest version of R, and use the remainder of that script to read in that list of packages and install them. That will take several minutes if you have a lot of packages."

Slides and example files will be available in my CSTAT.RR2025 repository, but will not be finalized until shortly before the webinar is delivered. A registration link is available on CSTAT’s events website.\nAbstract\n\nThis seminar will introduce the audience to a set of principles, practices, and free, open-source software tools that enable scientists to generate reproducible statistical analyses and reports. We will cover why reproducibility is important, then offer a vision of how to enhance the reproducibility of your work, with concrete steps you can take to achieve that goal. We will discuss tailoring the degree of reproducibility you aim to achieve for a given project, which may vary due to project context or constraints. In terms of software, we will describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of tools that uses dynamic documents to automate producing fully-formatted reports, manuscripts, or slides complete with narrative text, analysis results, figures, tables, and references. Git and GitHub.com add further value through support for version control and collaboration on the source code for dynamic documents. The session will include conceptual content, examples of dynamic documents, and links to supporting resources the audience can use to accelerate learning how to make their work more reproducible.\n\n\n\n2 MSU Program Evaluation Occasional Speaker Series\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, December 5) called Fundamentals of missing data in evaluation. Slides are available in my FMDE2024 repository and a video recording is also available.\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will discuss some fundamental concepts and issues related to missing data in program evaluation contexts. We will cover why missing data matters plus types of missing data and how they affect statistical results. Then we will highlight how to describe the nature, scope, and patterns of missing data and how they relate to observed data. Finally, we will discuss some ways to prevent missing data and options for obtaining valid, unbiased statistical results even when there is missing data.\n\n\n\n3 Ann Arbor R Users’ Group\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, November 14) called R and Quarto: A foundation for generating reproducible reports. Slides and example files are available in my Pierce.AARUG2024 repository.\nAbstract\n\nThis presentation will discuss the importance of reproducibility and illustrate how R and Quarto are foundational pieces of an integrated set of tools for generating fully-formatted, reproducible reports in a variety of output formats. We’ll cover some key principles and practices that enhance reproducibility.\n\n\n\n4 American Evaluation Association 2024\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, October 21-26) called Generating reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports: Principles, practices, and free software tools. Slides and example files are available in my Pierce.AEA2024 repository.\nAbstract\n\nFully reproducible statistical analyses are ones for which investigators have shared all the materials required to exactly recreate their findings so others can verify them or conduct alternative analyses. That requires sharing the original (usually de-identified) data, supporting documentation, and the software code used to analyze the data. While reproducibility has been described as an attainable minimum standard for trustworthy, credible scientific work; it is not yet well-embedded in evaluators’ professional training. This session will introduce the audience to a set of principles, practices, and free, open-source software tools that enable evaluators to efficiently generate reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports. We will cover why reproducibility is important in an evaluation context, then offer a vision of how to improve the reproducibility of your work and suggest concrete steps you can take to achieve that goal. We will discuss tailoring the degree of reproducibility you aim to achieve for a given project, which may vary due to project context or constraints. In terms of software, we will describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text along with R code that can be compiled to automate producing a fully-formatted report, manuscript, or set of slides complete with narrative text, analysis results, figures, tables, and references.

    "title": "Draft vs. Production Output",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is describes a practical example of applying the separation principle for reproducible research. Specifically, it describes why and how I separate draft versus production versions of my output. The post assumes you have already installed some specific software for reproducible research.\nI develop a research compendium for each of my statistical projects. My usual approach is to create a Git repository for a custom R package, part of which is a Quarto project. There are often multiple Quarto scripts that use R code chunks to do various tasks such as importing, cleaning, managing, and analyzing data, then reporting the results.\n\nWhy Separate Draft vs. Production Output?\nDeveloping my scripts is an iterative process. I render drafts many times per day as I add or edit code, but I only need to do occasional production runs. The draft outputs are disposable intermediate artifacts. If needed, I can recover interim draft output by returning to a specific Git commit and re-running the code as it existed at that point in time.\nProduction output files are another matter entirely. I find it useful to retain a version history of all rendered production output files distributed to clients, research partners, or other stakeholders. That way when someone wants to discuss an output with me, I can quickly find, open, and review it without having to re-run code.\n\n\nMy Requirements for Output Files\nFor most projects and scripts, I find it useful to impose a small set of requirements on output file names. They must:\n\nShow which script generated the output.\nClarify draft versus production status.\nDistinguish between different production runs of the same script.\nShow what output format was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMy personal convention is to assign filenames by combining three pieces: a stem, a suffix, and a file extension.\n\nThe stem is a text string that matches the name of the script that produces the output (addressing requirement #1). For example, a script called Import_Data.qmd leads to a stem of Import_Data.\nThe suffix consists of either the string _Draft for draft outputs, or a date in _YYYY-MM-DD format for production outputs. That addresses both requirements #2 and #3.\nThe file extension then shows what output format was used (e.g., HTML or PDF). That addresses requirement #4.\n\nSo, Import_Data_Draft.html is a draft HTML output, while Import_Data_2025-01-16.html and Import_Data_2025-02-16.html are production HTML outputs run a month apart.\n\n\nDate-stamping the production output file names makes sorting files to find the most current version of the results simple. We can also easily compare those to prior versions because we retain all production outputs as separate files.\n\n\nDefaulting to Draft Output\nSaving every draft output file I generate would clutter my folders with tons of interim files that would differ in only small ways. Therefore, I just overwrite my draft output file each time I render a script on its own. That reduces storage space consumed. Storage space may be very cheap, but still ought to be used sensibly to facilitate usability and finding things.\nTo demonstrate my approach, I created a file called Example1.qmd that contains the following text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample1.qmd\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Example 1: Separating Draft vs. Production Output\"\nauthor: \n  - name: Steven J. Pierce\n    orcid: 0000-0002-0679-3019\n    email: pierces1@msu.edu\nformat: \n  html:\n    output-file: \"Example1_Draft.html\"\n    embed-resources: true \n  pdf:\n    output-file: \"Example1_Draft.pdf\"\n---\n\nThis file is used to demonstrate YAML configuration I use to set the default \noutput file names for draft HTML and PDF output. The same script can also \ngenerate production output by over-riding the default output file name at the \ntime of rendering. \n\n\n\nThe format: key section of the YAML header controls what types of output will be produced. This one specifies both html: and pdf: output files will be written and uses a separate output-file: key for each one to specify the default output file names. Rendering Example1.qmd on its own from within the RStudio interface (clicking the Render button) will create both files using the default names. Figure 1 shows the process at a conceptual level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetDraft\n\n\n\nScript\n\nExample1.qmd\n(Quarto Script)\n\n\n\nHTML\n\nExample1_Draft.html\n(HTML Output)\n\n\n\nScript-&gt;HTML\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\nPDF\n\nExample1_Draft.pdf\n(PDF Output)\n\n\n\nScript-&gt;PDF\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Render Example1.qmd to Get Draft Output\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, you can remove one of the output format keys from the YAML header to get just one output file in whichever format you prefer.\nHere are links to the draft output files:\n\nExample1_Draft.html\nExample1_Draft.pdf\n\n\n\nObtaining Production Output\nWhat remains then is to demonstrate how I get those date-stamped production outputs. For that, I create a production script (e.g., Production_Run.qmd) that can render other scripts to automatically date-stamped, customized output file names as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetProduction\n\n\n\nProd\n\nProduction_Run.qmd\n(Quarto Script)\n\n\n\nLog\n\nProduction_Run.html\n(HTML Output)\n\n\n\nProd-&gt;Log\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\nScript\n\nExample1.qmd\n(Quarto Script)\n\n\n\nProd-&gt;Script\n\n\nPass\nfile\nnames\n\n\n\nHTML\n\nExample1_2025-02-16.html\n(HTML Output)\n\n\n\nScript-&gt;HTML\n\n\nCustomized\n\n\n\nPDF\n\nExample1_2025-02-16.pdf\n(PDF Output)\n\n\n\nScript-&gt;PDF\n\n\nCustomized\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Render Production_Run.qmd to Get Date-Stamped, Production Output\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the basic content of the Production_Run.qmd script. You would need to replace the double curly braces {r} with single curly braces {r} to get this to run (the double braces disable execution of those chunks).\nHere is a link to a production output file, namely Example1_2025-02-16.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction_Run.qmd\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Production Run Control Script\"\nauthor: \n  - name: Steven J.
