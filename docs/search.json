    "text": "Statisticians can demonstrate leadership in research projects by advocating for and engaging in reproducible research (Hochheimer et al., 2024). Reproducible research can be facilitated by using a set of software packages that combine into a powerful, integrated set of tools. The statistical software R, paired with RStudio Desktop (RStudio Team, 2024), is the foundation for a set of tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text along with R code that can be compiled to automatically produce a fully-formatted report or manuscript complete with text, figures, and tables generated by running the code (Mair, 2016).\nWhile (Mair, 2016) introduces R Markdown as a tool for writing dynamic documents, Quarto (Allaire et al., 2024) is a next-generation tool that replaces R Markdown. Quarto will be a key part of the future of scientific publishing for those who want to do reproducible research. It can produce documents in many different formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and many more). Combining Quarto with TinyTeX enables production of very nice PDF files, which are great for distribution and archiving. Meanwhile, Git (Torvalds et al., 2024) and GitHub solve source code version control problems and facilitate collaboration on code (Bryan, 2018).\nMarwick, Boettiger, & Mullen (2018) discuss creating research compendiums that bundle collections of documents along with data files into custom R packages to make a research project more reproducible. These software packages become an additional scholarly product that make manuscripts more reproducible."

The best way to do that is to use a script such as Reinstall_Packages.R under the older version to save a data file containing the names of installed packages, then remove the older version of R and replace it with the newest version of R, and use the remainder of that script to read in that list of packages and install them. That will take several minutes if you have a lot of packages."

    "text": "In addition to providing access to custom R functions, one can use custom R packages as research compendiums (Marwick et al., 2018) that organize raw data, documentation, data management and analysis scripts, and statistical results in a convenient format. The scripts can contain narrative text interleaved with R code that can manage data and insert formatted text, tables, figures, and reference sections when you render the script into a dynamic document. Below is a list of the publicly accessible R packages that I have developed. I have others in preparation that will remain private repositories until relevant scholarly products have been published.\nSome of the packages listed below relied on R Markdown scripts, but I have subsequently adopted a newer, more capable set of software tools for producing the research compendiums I have in preparation now.\n\n1 piercer\nThe piercer package is my personal package of miscellaneous functions for use in my research and statistical consulting work. It is not particularly large, but developing it has been an excellent learning experience.\n\n\n2 SAWpaper\nThe SAWpaper package contains the code and raw output for one of my papers (Winke et al., 2023). This paper used a continuation-ratio model to examine the validity of a computer-adaptive self-assessment of second language learners’ speaking proficiency.\n\n\n3 SSACHR\nThis SSACHR package contains the code and raw output for a paper that used criminal history data for suspected serial sexual offenders to examine the potential impact of mandatory forensic testing of sexual assault kits on crime prevention (Campbell et al., 2022).
