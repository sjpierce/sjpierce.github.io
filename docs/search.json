    "text": "Statisticians can demonstrate leadership in research projects by advocating for and engaging in reproducible research (Hochheimer et al., 2024). Reproducible research can be facilitated by using a set of software packages that combine into a powerful, integrated set of tools. The statistical software R, paired with RStudio Desktop (RStudio Team, 2024), is the foundation for a set of tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text along with R code that can be compiled to automatically produce a fully-formatted report, manuscript, website, or set of presentation slides complete with text, equations, figures, tables, and reference sections (Mair, 2016).\nWhile (Mair, 2016) introduces R Markdown as a tool for writing dynamic documents, Quarto (Allaire et al., 2024) is a next-generation tool that replaces R Markdown. Quarto will be a key part of the future of scientific publishing for those who want to do reproducible research. It can produce documents in many different formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and many more). Combining Quarto with TinyTeX enables production of very nice PDF files, which are great for distribution and archiving. Meanwhile, Git (Torvalds et al., 2024) and GitHub solve source code version control problems and facilitate collaboration on code (Bryan, 2018).\nMarwick, Boettiger, & Mullen (2018) discuss creating research compendiums that bundle collections of documents along with data files into custom R packages to make a research project more reproducible. These software packages become additional scholarly products that make manuscripts more reproducible."

The best way to do that is to use a script such as Reinstall_Packages.R under the older version to save a data file containing the names of installed packages, then remove the older version of R and replace it with the newest version of R, and use the remainder of that script to read in that list of packages and install them. That will take several minutes if you have a lot of packages."

    "text": "In addition to providing access to custom R functions, one can use R packages as research compendiums (Marwick et al., 2018) that organize raw data, documentation, data management scripts, analysis scripts, and statistical results in a convenient format. The scripts can contain narrative text interleaved with R code that can manage data and insert formatted text, tables, figures, and reference sections when you render the script into a dynamic document. Below is a list of my publicly accessible R packages. I have others in preparation that will remain private repositories until relevant scholarly products have been published.\nSome of the packages listed below relied on R Markdown scripts, but I have subsequently adopted a newer, more capable set of software tools for producing the research compendiums I have in preparation now.\n\n1 piercer\nThe piercer package is my personal package of miscellaneous functions for use in my research and statistical consulting work. It is not particularly large, but developing it has been an excellent learning experience.\n\n\n2 SAWpaper\nThe SAWpaper package contains the code and raw output for one of my papers (Winke et al., 2023).

Slides and example files will be available in my CSTAT.RR2025 repository.\nAbstract\n\nThis seminar will introduce the audience to a set of principles, practices, and free, open-source software tools that enable scientists to generate reproducible statistical analyses and reports. We will cover why reproducibility is important, then offer a vision of how to enhance the reproducibility of your work, with concrete steps you can take to achieve that goal. We will discuss tailoring the degree of reproducibility you aim to achieve for a given project, which may vary due to project context or constraints. In terms of software, we will describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of tools that uses dynamic documents to automate producing fully-formatted reports, manuscripts, or slides complete with narrative text, analysis results, figures, tables, and references. Git and GitHub.com add further value through support for version control and collaboration on the source code for dynamic documents. The session will include conceptual content, examples of dynamic documents, and links to supporting resources the audience can use to accelerate learning how to make their work more reproducible.\n\n\n\n2 MSU Program Evaluation Occasional Speaker Series\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, December 5) called Fundamentals of missing data in evaluation. Slides are available in my FMDE2024 repository and a video recording is also available\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will discuss some fundamental concepts and issues related to missing data in program evaluation contexts. We will cover why missing data matters plus types of missing data and how they affect statistical results. Then we will highlight how to describe the nature, scope, and patterns of missing data and how they relate to observed data. Finally, we will discuss some ways to prevent missing data and options for obtaining valid, unbiased statistical results even when there is missing data.\n\n\n\n3 Ann Arbor R Users’ Group\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, November 14) called R and Quarto: A foundation for generating reproducible reports. Slides and example files are available in my Pierce.AARUG2024 repository.\nAbstract\n\nThis presentation will discuss the importance of reproducibility and illustrate how R and Quarto are foundational pieces of an integrated set of tools for generating fully-formatted, reproducible reports in a variety of output formats. We’ll cover some key principles and practices that enhance reproducibility.\n\n\n\n4 American Evaluation Association 2024\nBelow is the abstract for my presentation (Pierce, 2024, October 21-26) called Generating reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports: Principles, practices, and free software tools. Slides and example files are available in my Pierce.AEA2024 repository.\nAbstract\n\nFully reproducible statistical analyses are ones for which investigators have shared all the materials required to exactly recreate their findings so others can verify them or conduct alternative analyses. That requires sharing the original (usually de-identified) data, supporting documentation, and the software code used to analyze the data. While reproducibility has been described as an attainable minimum standard for trustworthy, credible scientific work; it is not yet well-embedded in evaluators’ professional training. This session will introduce the audience to a set of principles, practices, and free, open-source software tools that enable evaluators to efficiently generate reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports. We will cover why reproducibility is important in an evaluation context, then offer a vision of how to improve the reproducibility of your work and suggest concrete steps you can take to achieve that goal. We will discuss tailoring the degree of reproducibility you aim to achieve for a given project, which may vary due to project context or constraints. In terms of software, we will describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text along with R code that can be compiled to automate producing a fully-formatted report, manuscript, or set of slides complete with narrative text, analysis results, figures, tables, and references.
