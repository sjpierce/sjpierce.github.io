This is where I'll post information about recent or upcoming presentations 

# CSTAT Webinar
Below is the abstract for my upcoming presentation [@Pierce-RN8692] called 
*Reproducible research: Principles, practices, and tools for generating* 
*reproducible statistical analyses and reports*. Slides and example files will 
be available in my 
[CSTAT.RR2025 repository](https://github.com/sjpierce/CSTAT.RR2025), but will 
not be finalized until shortly before the webinar is delivered. A 
[registration link](https://cstat.msu.edu/event/reproducible-research-principles-practices-and-tools-generating-reproducible-statistical) 
is available on [CSTAT's events website](https://cstat.msu.edu/events).   

**Abstract**

> This seminar will introduce the audience to a set of principles, practices, 
> and free, open-source software tools that enable scientists to generate 
> reproducible statistical analyses and reports. We will cover why 
> reproducibility is important, then offer a vision of how to enhance the 
> reproducibility of your work, with concrete steps you can take to achieve that 
> goal. We will discuss tailoring the degree of reproducibility you aim to 
> achieve for a given project, which may vary due to project context or 
> constraints. In terms of software, we will describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, 
> and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of tools that uses dynamic documents to 
> automate producing fully-formatted reports, manuscripts, or slides complete 
> with narrative text, analysis results, figures, tables, and references. Git 
> and GitHub.com add further value through support for version control and 
> collaboration on the source code for dynamic documents. The session will 
> include conceptual content, examples of dynamic documents, and links to 
> supporting resources the audience can use to accelerate learning how to make 
> their work more reproducible.

# MSU Program Evaluation Occasional Speaker Series
Below is the abstract for my presentation [@Pierce-RN8663] called *Fundamentals* 
*of missing data in evaluation*. Slides are available in
my [FMDE2024 repository](https://github.com/sjpierce/FMDE2024) and a 
[video recording](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/t/1_9gisp7ga) is also 
available.

**Abstract**

> This talk will discuss some fundamental concepts and issues related to missing
> data in program evaluation contexts. We will cover why missing data matters 
> plus types of missing data and how they affect statistical results. Then we 
> will highlight how to describe the nature, scope, and patterns of missing data 
> and how they relate to observed data. Finally, we will discuss some ways to 
> prevent missing data and options for obtaining valid, unbiased statistical 
> results even when there is missing data.

# Ann Arbor R Users' Group
Below is the abstract for my presentation [@Pierce-RN8655] called *R and*
*Quarto: A foundation for generating reproducible reports*. Slides and example 
files are available in my 
[Pierce.AARUG2024 repository](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AARUG2024). 

**Abstract**

> This presentation will discuss the importance of reproducibility and 
> illustrate how R and Quarto are foundational pieces of an integrated set of 
> tools for generating fully-formatted, reproducible reports in a variety of 
> output formats. We'll cover some key principles and practices that enhance
> reproducibility.

# American Evaluation Association 2024
Below is the abstract for my presentation [@Pierce-RN8577] called *Generating*
*reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports: Principles,*
*practices, and free software tools*. Slides and example files are available in
my [Pierce.AEA2024 repository](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024). 

**Abstract**

> Fully reproducible statistical analyses are ones for which investigators have 
> shared all the materials required to exactly recreate their findings so 
> others can verify them or conduct alternative analyses. That requires sharing 
> the original (usually de-identified) data, supporting documentation, and the 
> software code used to analyze the data. While reproducibility has been 
> described as an attainable minimum standard for trustworthy, credible 
> scientific work; it is not yet well-embedded in evaluatorsâ€™ professional 
> training. This session will introduce the audience to a set of principles, 
> practices, and free, open-source software tools that enable evaluators to 
> efficiently generate reproducible statistical analyses and evaluation reports. 
> We will cover why reproducibility is important in an evaluation context, then 
> offer a vision of how to improve the reproducibility of your work and suggest 
> concrete steps you can take to achieve that goal. We will discuss tailoring 
> the degree of reproducibility you aim to achieve for a given project, which 
> may vary due to project context or constraints. In terms of software, we will 
> describe how R, RStudio, Quarto, and TinyTex comprise a powerful suite of 
> tools that can generate dynamic documents containing a mix of narrative text 
> along with R code that can be compiled to automate producing a fully-formatted 
> report, manuscript, or set of slides complete with narrative text, analysis 
> results, figures, tables, and references. Git and GitHub.com add further value 
> through support for version control and collaboration on the source code for 
> dynamic documents. The session will include conceptual content, examples of 
> dynamic documents, and links to supporting resources the audience can use to 
> accelerate learning how to make their work more reproducible.
